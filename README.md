# Novelty-components-of-scientific-productions
As part of our Master Data Science for Economy and Business, we want to develop our skills in Data Vizualisation by proposing a Dashboard that will present different components of the novelty of scientific productions from the OpenAlex database.

We'll start with a sample of 1,000 articles from OpenAlex Database based on the keyword “Substainable Development Goal”, the aim is to identify a scientific subfield to define whether the method of the article employs/discusses digital technologies. We will explain the novelty potential of scientific productions talking about SDGs through the use of digital technologies, and to bring out evidence linked to the characteristics of the articles and their production conditions.
